# Wine-Quality-Prediction

The objective of the project is to predict the quality of red wine given factors such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity,citric acid, residual sugar etc.
A random forest classifier model- ensembler model which takes a majority vote of decision trees is used with 66 percent accuracy.
Other factors are analysed such as quality vs citric acid which is directly proportional to one another, and quality vs volatile acidity which is inversely proportional to each other.
